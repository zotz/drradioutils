This is for Rivendell utilities.

Info for rivexport stuff.

Currently I only discuss situations where /var/snd and the mysql database 
are on the same machine.

This machine needs to run apache or some other suitable web server as well.

I put the php stuff in /var/www/riv

I create an directory to hold the exported files as /var/sndexport

I add the following section to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

    Alias /sndexport/ "/var/sndexport/"
    <Directory "/var/sndexport/">
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

In the web browser. I point to http://rivbox/riv/

Click on rivexport.php

Choose page that has files you want to export. Choose file(s) to export. Click
the button to get the bakk rolling.

When done, hit the browser back arrow and choose some more to export or go to 
http://rivbox/sndexport and you shoud see the exported files as:

010009_001.wav
010015_001.wav

cartno_cutno.wav files

and as

Artist_Album_Song.mp3 files.

You will need lame and id3v2 installed for the compression to mp3 to work.
