Thoughts / notes on the output side of things:

Combo 1:

ffmpeg -re -i /var/vid/700002.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -vprofile baseline -g 30 -acodec aac -strict -2 -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/stream

sends to an nxinx rtmp server

vlc --fullscreen rtmp://localhost:1935/live/stream pulls from the rtmp stream created above and displays on physical screen.

Best ways to get bash script, possibly on another machine to execure the ffmpeg line above for each video to be played. I am thinking ssh with remote execution for now.
I have not played with this enough yet to knkow if the fullscreen will cause issues like it seems to in Combo 2 below.

Combo 2:

cvlc -I http --http-src /usr/share/vlc/lua/http --http-host 192.168.86.145 --http-port 9090 --http-password foo --extra-intf rc --rc-host 192.168.86.145:4212
or
cvlc --fullscreen -I http --http-src /usr/share/vlc/lua/http --http-host 192.168.86.145 --http-port 9090 --http-password foo --extraintf rc --rc-host 192.168.86.145:4212

the above is fed via a bash script with netcat, currently from another machine, the line that does it is:

echo "add /var/vid/$1.mp4" | nc 192.168.86.145 4212

the fullscreen option looks better but seems to cause problems.
