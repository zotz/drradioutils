I don't have a proper name for this yet. It is still very *dirty* and more
than a bit of a mess.

It is largely unfinished as well but I have been putting off making it public
for too long now. Excuse the mess. Jump in now if you want to help.

What's the deal?

This was written with restaurants and clubs in mind to allow their customers
to choose what music gets played.

In the long run, I want to enable actual payments as well as a limited number 
of free credits per customer etc.

The system does not have a decent name yet.

The system uses the wonderful Rivendell Radio Automation system as a base.

Thanks guys, I hope in the long run this effort brings more customers your way.

The way I am doing things currently is to let the rivz database live on the 
mysql server that has the regular rivendell database. Three of the tables in
the rivz database are actually views pulled from the Rivendell database. They
are used in a read only fashion. Two of the tables are actual tables and are 
written to by the system. I grant the rduser the same rights on the rivz 
database as it has on the Rivendell database.

Put the files in a directory in /var/www, I have mine in:

/var/www/rivz

The rivfeed4.php file needs to be running at all times for the system to 
function properly. For testing, just launch from a terminal.

So, set up a running Rivendell. Load up a log in rdairplay and stary it 
playing. Launch rivfeed4.php from a terminal and leave it running. Access 
rivlcient4.php in your browser. Eg:

http://localhost/rivz/rivclient4.php

You should be able to browse your entire music library. When you choose a song
and bid on it, it should show up in the Queue section. Songs in the queue
section get fed into rdairplay via a makenext using rmlsend.

This is likely incomplete and confusing. Let me know and we can make it better.

all the best,

drew
