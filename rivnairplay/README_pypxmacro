# Going to try and work like this
######PX mach cart [offset] [PLAY|SEGUE|STOP]!

So, this is intended to work with loaded and running logs.

It is supposed to give a similar/identical result to 

PX mach cart [offset] [PLAY|SEGUE|STOP]

when invoked like this for example:

./pypxmacro.py 0 999999 7 SEGUE

0 is the machine
999999 is the cart (test tone)
7 is the offset,
SEGUE is the transition type.

I likely need lots of help. Testing, and some python regular expression help would probably go a long way.

Oh, I think this will only work if the loaded log is set to auto refresh.
