README for first efforts at a "new" rdairplay called for now rdnairplay. Newer notes at bottom.
November 10/2023

Right now this is in python.
It is dirty code.
If makes a lot of simplifying assumptions for now.
It has a lot of stuff hard coded that needs to be choosable in the interface.
Lots more problems I know about and likely a lot that I don't.
Assumes that the logmachine being monitored has been generated, loaded, tun, but not modified.
Right now though, I can use it to see where I am in a virtual log machine that is active.

I first documented my latest idea for something like this here:

https://github.com/ElvishArtisan/rivendell/issues/887

Advice, help, takeover welcome.

If you have any interest in this but need to get it running, i WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP.

Assumptions for command line choosing and more.

I have no rivendell 4 boxes in "production"
I have some in testing.
This work is being done on one of those testing machines .

I have 5 services: AP1, AP2, AP3, AP4, and VID

Their log name templates look like:

AP1_%Y_%m_%d
..
AP4_%Y_%m_%d
VID_%Y_%m_%d

matching pyPAD filewrites follow these samples:

Filename=/tmp/rivnan/current_AP4.txt
Append=0
FormatString=:%n:%x:\n

I am changing the example pypad files to match the new naming convention.
