README for first efforts at a "new" rdairplay called for now rdnairplay
August 09/2023

Right now this is in python.
It is dirty code.
If makes a lot of simplifying assumptions for now.
It has a lot of stuff hard coded that needs to be choosable in the interface.
Lots more problems I know about and likely a lot that I don't.
Assumes that the logmachine being monitored has been generated, loaded, tun, but not modified.
Right now though, I can use it to see where I am in a virtual log machine that is active.

I first documented my latest idea for something like this here:

Advice, help, takeover welcome.

If you have any interest in this but need to get it running, i WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP.
