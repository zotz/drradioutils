Notes for:

Rivendell
Jack
Glassgui
Icecast

and perhaps more.

Curently based on Centos7 and Rivendell 3.x

* Getting Rivendell to start jack on boot *

This can be done with a dummy sound card or an actual sound card.

rdadmin->Manage Hosts->Edit desired host->Jack Settings:
  Select Start Jack Server
  Jack Server Name: rivendell or rivendell_2, etc.
  Jack Command Line: /usr/bin/jackd -ddummy -r48000 -p4096
  Active Audio Ports: 8
  Jack Command Line: /usr/bin/jackd -dalsa -dhw:ICH7 -r44100 -p2048 -n3
  Active Audio Ports: 2
Last 4 lines are samples for dummy card and one onboard card.

When you reboot and rivendell is started (say you start rdiarplay, rivendell should start jackd and a "ps ax | grep jackd" in a terminal should show
a line similar to the one you have configured as the Jack Command Line above.

Workflow on reboot:

user rd set to log in to desktop automatically.
afterairplay.desktop in /home/rd/.config.autostart is run on user login and in turn runs /home/rd/afterairplay.sh
afterairplay.sh then runs rdairplay (at which point, rivendell should run jackd as root) and then sudo /root/runglasscoder.sh
/root/runglasscoder.sh then runs /usr/bin/qjackctl and then runs /root/restartgc.sh
/root/restartgc.sh then runs glassgui and makes the connections in the jack graph.
