Rivendell Request System

Start of README.md for rivreq

If you are running Rivendell as your Radio Automation System and you would like to let your listeners request from a list of songs you choose and to have the most popular choice play in the next hour, the Rivendell Request System could be for you.

It is currently a 3 machine system but it could be a 2 machine system.

The three machines are:

m1 - Rivendell machine.
m2 - raspberry pi that serves as a middle man.
m3 - web server that the users go to to interact with the system.
